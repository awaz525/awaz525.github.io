            This project is representative of my time majoring in accounting for two years and how that affected every facet of my life. At a point, I realized that I didn't want to study accounting, but I was unsure of what I wanted. I felt stuck, and the images I created are a reflection of how I felt at the time. I had no idea what I was going through at the time until I got past it and looked back. Prior to the start of this project, I had never discussed that part of my life with anyone because it felt embarrassing. Perhaps photography is my emotional outlet. Given the circumstances created with Covid-19, these images could relate to more people now than it did before the pandemic.
